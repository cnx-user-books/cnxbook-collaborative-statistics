and Homework Book for Collaborative Statistics by R. Bloom

<link document="col10619">http://cnx.org/content/col10619/  </link> 

These custom collections are based on the textbook collection Collaborative Statistics, by Illowsky, B.and S.Dean, Connexions Web site, http://cnx.org/content/col10522/1.29/, Dec 5, 2008, but have been modified, as detailed in this module.  If future modifications are made to the custom collection, this module will be updated to contain current information.
